## Database setup and creation

1. Copy server `.env` file into a new file `.env.local` and replace username and password.
2. Either in the mysql terminal or in the db manager of your choice, log in `mysql -u YOUR_USERNAME -p` and then put in your password
3. Run the following queries to set up the database and create the tables
```
CREATE DATABASE cookingwithsutto;
USE cookingwithsutto;
```

```
CREATE TABLE recipes (
id CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY, -- UUID for the recipe
title TEXT NOT NULL, -- Recipe title
date TIMESTAMP, -- Timestamp of when the recipe was created/updated
image_url VARCHAR(255) -- URL of the recipe image
);

CREATE TABLE ingredients (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
recipe_id CHAR(36), -- UUID for the recipe this ingredient belongs to
amount DECIMAL(10, 2), -- Amount of the ingredient (e.g., 1.75)
unit VARCHAR(50), -- Measurement unit (e.g., "cups", "grams")
name VARCHAR(255), -- Ingredient name (e.g., "flour")
FOREIGN KEY (recipe_id) REFERENCES recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE steps (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
recipe_id CHAR(36), -- UUID for the recipe this step belongs to
image_url VARCHAR(255), -- URL of the image associated with the step (optional)
title VARCHAR(255), -- Title of the step (optional, e.g., "Mix Ingredients")
text TEXT NOT NULL, -- Text description of the step (required)
image_position ENUM('left', 'right') DEFAULT 'right', -- predefined positions for image placement
FOREIGN KEY (recipe_id) REFERENCES recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
4. Run the following query to set up the recipes table
```
INSERT INTO recipes (id, title, date, image_url) VALUES
(UUID(), 'How to make fresh pasta', '2023-11-20 08:45:23', 'fresh-pasta.jpg'),
(UUID(), 'Basic pasta sauce', '2023-08-14 13:22:10', 'basic-pasta-sauce.jpg'),
(UUID(), 'Birthday Cake', '2023-05-01 12:00:00', 'birthday-cake.jpg'),
(UUID(), 'Uovo alla coque', '2023-09-10 07:25:12', 'uovo-alla-coque.jpg'),
(UUID(), 'Braised short ribs', '2023-06-30 18:55:00', 'braised-short-ribs.jpg'),
(UUID(), 'Fruit tart', '2023-03-21 14:33:55', 'fruit-tart.jpg');
```
5. After you create your new recipes with new UUIDs, get the UUIDs by running `SELECT * FROM recipes;` and then replace the placeholders for UUIDs with the real UUIDs in the code below, then run the code to add data to the ingredients table

```
INSERT INTO ingredients (recipe_id, amount, unit, name) VALUES
