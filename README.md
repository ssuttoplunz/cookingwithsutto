# Cooking With Sutto

## Summary
This is a repo for my fun side project of posting recipes on my own website: [cookingwithsutto.com](https://cookingwithsutto.com/)
- It currently is a very simeple Vue/ Vite project that loads all the data from a JSON file
- The development branch has the latest including a Node.js/Express server, and mysql db for the data
- I am looking into hosting the db and server, and hopefuly that will go live soon!

## Roadmap
- Adding openapi or swagger docs for the server
  - Share the same types across server + client
- Adding unit testing
- Add server side validation for endpoints
- Find somewhere to host server + db so the latest code can go live onto the website
